Final Project Proposal
Introduction

A growing amount of research has studied the economic contribution of the outdoor recreation industry. In particular, mountain biking has been shown to deliver a positive impact to communities by attracting visitors, stimulating new job creation, encouraging migration, and contributing to development of a sense of place. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive web map that serves as a platform to share information about the economic impact of mountain. The focus will be on 15 study areas around National Forest lands in Colorado, Montana, and North Carolina. The working title for this assignment is Trail Treasures: Comparing the Economic Impact of Mountain Biking on Six National Forests.
This topic is meaningful to me because I spent two years working in partnership with the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia on an initiative to promote trails-based tourism in order to advance economic development in rural communities. During this time, I worked closely with the International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA), an advocacy group involved in producing reports on the economic development of mountain biking. One of the strategies used to get additional stakeholders on board with this effort was to share examples of model trail communities that demonstrate the positive impacts that result from investing in trails. A problem that I encountered is the fact that many potential partners could not physically visit a model trail community and hear the story of impact of trails. The proposed project is an opportunity to reach around this barrier by representing model trail communities in the format map of an interactive web map.
Objective
The goal of this project is to provide information about the economic impact of mountain biking in order to promote trail stewardship and investment. The primary audience for the map will be community leaders with an interest in economic development. The text that follows is an example of a scenario for a user of the map.
Jane is a community leader in a small town. Since the logging industry has been on the decline, the population of her town has been gradually decreasing as residents have moved away. Community groups have been discussing ways in which the main street area of their town can be revitalized and the tourism industry can be developed in their area. There is a small bike shop in town and the owner has mentioned that more visitors would come to their town if the nearby trail system was expanded to connect to the town park. Jane is not sure that mountain bike tourism is a worthwhile opportunity but wants to learn more, since the bike shop is one of the few businesses open on main street. Other community members are passionate and energetic, so Jane is curious when viewing this web page.
Jane recognizes one of the places highlighted on the web page because her nephew mentioned passing through there on a road trip. She pans over to this location on the map and zooms in. New information appears after zooming in and Jane reads about the large effect visitors have on the economy. She sees that there is a very large network of trails surrounding this community shown on the map. Jane then pans over to another town. She notices that it is similar in size to her town but has a dense trail system with a trail connected to the central business area. The numbers showing information about economic impact changed when Jane focused the map on this second location.

Plan
I will create an interactive web map displaying data on the economic impact of mountain biking primarily using the Leaflet JavaScript library. The data will be loaded onto the map as a point layer. Additional layers to provide context may include polygons data for National Forest Boundaries and line data for trail centerlines, along with a basemap. Text, images, and design elements will complement the map using HTML and CSS. This map will be hosted using GitHub Pages on the domain robinmaps.com.
Data
The file named mtb_impacts will be converted to a point layer. The data is authored by James N. Maples and Michael J. Bradley and is provided in the format of reports commissioned by Outdoor Alliance.

[Economic Impact of Mountain Biking in the Nantahala and Pisgah National Forest](https://www.imba.com/sites/default/files/content/resources/2018-06/OA_NPNF_MtnBikingStudy.pdf)

I will create a point layer centered on the county or location of each study area and join the tabular data from the reports.

More context will be needed beyond just a regular basemap. So, I will get data from the [US Forest Service Enterprise Data](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/index.php) to show National Forest Boundaries. This data can be downloaded as a shapefile. To show trails, I can data from either [TrailForks](https://www.trailforks.com/about/api/) or [MTB Project](https://www.mtbproject.com/data). These platforms allow individual trails to be downloaded as a gpx or kml. However, I'm hoping that it would not be too advanced for me access the data for each study area using the JSON API and add that to my map. I may need some help to be able to get this to work...
